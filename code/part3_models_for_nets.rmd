# Introduction: Why Standard Statistics Fail for Networks

## The Independence Assumption Problem

Imagine trying to understand a conversation by analyzing each person's words in isolation, ignoring who they're talking to and what others are saying. That's essentially what we do when we apply standard statistical methods to network data - we miss the fundamental reality that actors are embedded in webs of relationships that shape their behaviors and outcomes.

In traditional statistics, we assume observations are independent. But in networks, this assumption is fundamentally violated. If the ECHO hub adopts a new practice, connected spokes are more likely to adopt it too - not because of their individual characteristics, but because of their network connection. This interdependence isn't a nuisance to be corrected; it's the very phenomenon we want to study.

### The Challenge of Network Inference

Network data presents unique statistical challenges:

1.  **Autocorrelation**: Connected actors tend to have similar outcomes
2.  **Simultaneity**: Network position and outcomes co-evolve
3.  **Selection vs Influence**: Do birds of a feather flock together, or do flocked birds become similar?
4.  **Dyadic dependence**: The relationship between A and B affects the relationship between B and C

These challenges require specialized statistical approaches. In this session, we'll explore both traditional methods (with their limitations) and network-specific models designed to handle these complexities.

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this notebook, you'll understand: - How to use network measures in regression models (and why this is problematic) - The concept of network autocorrelation and its consequences - Network formation models and what they reveal - How to choose between different modeling approaches - How to translate model results into actionable insights

# Section 1: Network Measures in Traditional Models

## The Intuitive (But Flawed) Approach

The most straightforward way to incorporate network information into analysis is to treat network measures like any other variable. Want to know if well-connected clinics have better outcomes? Just run a regression with degree centrality as a predictor. This approach is intuitive, uses familiar methods, and often yields interesting results. But it's also fundamentally flawed in ways we need to understand.

### Preparing Our Analysis Dataset

Let's combine network measures with node attributes to create a dataset for traditional analysis:

```{r prepare-data}
# Merge network and attribute data
analysis_df <- centrality_df %>%
  left_join(nodes, by = c("actor" = "node_id")) %>%
  # Create derived variables for analysis
  mutate(
    # Log transformations for skewed variables
    log_staff_size = log(staff_size + 1),
    log_patient_volume = log(patient_volume + 1),
    
    # Binary indicators
    is_rural = if_else(rural_urban == "rural", 1, 0),
    high_participation = if_else(participation_rate > median(participation_rate), 1, 0),
    
    # Standardized centrality for interpretation
    betweenness_std = scale(betweenness)[,1],
    degree_std = scale(total_degree)[,1],
    
    # Use participation_rate consistently
    participation = participation_rate
  ) %>%
  # Remove any duplicate columns
  select(-any_of(c("participation.x", "participation.y")))

cat("ANALYSIS DATASET PREPARED:\n")
cat("==========================\n")
cat("Observations:", nrow(analysis_df), "actors\n")
cat("Variables:", ncol(analysis_df), "features\n")
cat("Node types:", paste(unique(analysis_df$type), collapse = ", "), "\n")
cat("States represented:", length(unique(analysis_df$state)), "\n")
```

### Research Question: Does Network Position Predict Engagement?

This is a natural question for ECHO programs: Are well-connected sites more engaged? Let's explore this relationship, keeping in mind the statistical issues we'll encounter.

```{r explore-relationship}
cat("\n=== EXPLORING THE POSITION-PARTICIPATION RELATIONSHIP ===\n\n")

# First, let's visualize the relationship
ggplot(analysis_df, aes(x = total_degree, y = participation)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = type, size = staff_size), alpha = 0.7) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = TRUE, color = "darkblue") +
  scale_color_manual(values = c(hub = "#E74C3C", spoke = "#3498DB", expert = "#F39C12")) +
  labs(
    title = "Network Position and Participation",
    subtitle = "Are better-connected sites more engaged?",
    x = "Degree Centrality (Total Connections)",
    y = "Participation Rate (%)",
    color = "Node Type",
    size = "Staff Size"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

# Calculate correlation
correlation <- cor(analysis_df$total_degree, analysis_df$participation, use = "complete.obs")
cat("Correlation between degree and participation:", round(correlation, 3), "\n")
cat("This suggests a", ifelse(abs(correlation) > 0.5, "strong", "moderate"), "relationship.\n")
cat("But correlation doesn't imply causation, especially in networks!\n")
```

## Model 1: Simple Linear Regression

Let's start with the simplest possible model:

```{r simple-model}
# Fit simple model
model1 <- lm(participation ~ total_degree, data = analysis_df)

cat("\nMODEL 1: SIMPLE LINEAR REGRESSION\n")
cat("==================================\n")
cat("participation = β₀ + β₁(degree) + ε\n\n")

# Display results
summary(model1)

# Interpretation
coef_degree <- coef(model1)["total_degree"]
cat("\nINTERPRETATION:\n")
cat("Each additional connection is associated with a", 
    round(coef_degree, 2), "percentage point increase in participation.\n")
cat("R-squared:", round(summary(model1)$r.squared, 3), "\n")

# But wait...
cat("\n⚠️ WARNING: This model assumes each clinic is independent!\n")
cat("In reality, connected clinics influence each other.\n")
cat("Our standard errors are likely underestimated.\n")
```

## Model 2: Multiple Regression with Controls

Real-world relationships are complex. Let's add control variables:

```{r multiple-regression}
# More sophisticated model
model2 <- lm(participation ~ 
             # Network measures
             total_degree + betweenness_std + 
             # Organizational characteristics
             years_in_echo + log_staff_size + 
             # Geographic factors
             is_rural + 
             # Node type
             factor(type), 
             data = analysis_df)

cat("\nMODEL 2: MULTIPLE REGRESSION\n")
cat("=============================\n")

# Tidy output
model2_results <- tidy(model2, conf.int = TRUE) %>%
  mutate(
    significant = if_else(p.value < 0.05, "***", 
                  if_else(p.value < 0.1, "*", "")),
    across(where(is.numeric), round, 3)
  )

kable(model2_results, caption = "Multiple Regression Results")

cat("\nMODEL QUALITY:\n")
glance(model2) %>%
  select(r.squared, adj.r.squared, sigma, AIC, BIC) %>%
  kable()
```

### Visualizing Model Results

```{r coefficient-plot}
# Coefficient plot
coef_plot_data <- model2_results %>%
  filter(term != "(Intercept)") %>%
  mutate(
    term_clean = case_when(
      term == "total_degree" ~ "Network Connections",
      term == "betweenness_std" ~ "Betweenness (std)",
      term == "years_in_echo" ~ "Years in ECHO",
      term == "log_staff_size" ~ "Staff Size (log)",
      term == "is_rural" ~ "Rural Location",
      str_detect(term, "type") ~ str_replace(term, "factor\\(type\\)", "Type: "),
      TRUE ~ term
    )
  )

ggplot(coef_plot_data, aes(x = estimate, y = reorder(term_clean, estimate))) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, linetype = "dashed", color = "gray50") +
  geom_point(aes(color = p.value < 0.05), size = 3) +
  geom_errorbarh(aes(xmin = conf.low, xmax = conf.high), height = 0.2) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("TRUE" = "#27ae60", "FALSE" = "gray60"),
                     labels = c("No", "Yes"), name = "Significant") +
  labs(
    title = "Factors Associated with Participation",
    subtitle = "Multiple regression coefficients with 95% CI",
    x = "Effect on Participation Rate (%)",
    y = ""
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

## Checking Model Assumptions (And Finding Problems)

Standard regression assumes independence. Let's check if this holds:

```{r diagnostics}
cat("\n=== DIAGNOSTIC CHECKS ===\n")

# Standard diagnostic plots
par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
plot(model2, which = c(1, 2, 3, 4))
par(mfrow = c(1, 1))

# The real problem: Network autocorrelation
cat("\nTESTING FOR NETWORK AUTOCORRELATION:\n")
cat("====================================\n")

# Get residuals
residuals_model2 <- residuals(model2)
names(residuals_model2) <- analysis_df$actor

# For each edge, calculate residual correlation
edge_residuals <- data.frame()
for(i in 1:nrow(edges)) {
  from_node <- edges$from[i]
  to_node <- edges$to[i]
  
  if(from_node %in% names(residuals_model2) & 
     to_node %in% names(residuals_model2)) {
    edge_residuals <- rbind(edge_residuals, data.frame(
      from = from_node,
      to = to_node,
      resid_from = residuals_model2[from_node],
      resid_to = residuals_model2[to_node]
    ))
  }
}

# Calculate correlation between connected nodes' residuals
residual_correlation <- cor(edge_residuals$resid_from, 
                           edge_residuals$resid_to, 
                           use = "complete.obs")

cat("\nRESIDUAL CORRELATION BETWEEN CONNECTED NODES:", 
    round(residual_correlation, 3), "\n")

if(abs(residual_correlation) > 0.1) {
  cat("\n⚠️ NETWORK AUTOCORRELATION DETECTED!\n")
  cat("Connected nodes have correlated residuals.\n")
  cat("This violates the independence assumption of OLS.\n")
  cat("Consequences:\n")
  cat("• Standard errors are underestimated\n")

# Section 2: Network Formation Models

## Understanding Why Ties Form

Instead of asking "how does network position affect outcomes?", network formation models ask "why do connections exist in the first place?" This shift in perspective is profound - we're modeling the generative process that creates the network structure we observe.

### The Logic of Dyadic Analysis

In network formation models, our unit of analysis shifts from nodes to dyads (pairs of nodes). For a network with n nodes, we have n×(n-1) potential directed relationships. Our goal is to understand what makes some of these potential ties actual ties.

```{r prepare-dyadic}
cat("=== PREPARING DYADIC DATA ===\n")
cat("=============================\n")

# Create all possible dyads
actors <- unique(c(edges$from, edges$to))
n_actors <- length(actors)

# Generate dyad dataset
dyad_df <- expand.grid(
  sender = actors,
  receiver = actors,
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
) %>%
  filter(sender != receiver) %>%  # Remove self-loops
  mutate(
    # Does this edge exist?
    edge_exists = 0
  )

# Mark existing edges
for(i in 1:nrow(edges)) {
  dyad_df$edge_exists[
    dyad_df$sender == edges$from[i] & 
    dyad_df$receiver == edges$to[i]
  ] <- 1
}

cat("DYADIC DATASET:\n")
cat("• Potential dyads:", nrow(dyad_df), "\n")
cat("• Actual edges:", sum(dyad_df$edge_exists), "\n")
cat("• Network density:", round(mean(dyad_df$edge_exists), 3), "\n")

cat("\nKEY INSIGHT:\n")
cat("We're now asking: What makes", sum(dyad_df$edge_exists), 
    "dyads connect\nwhile", sum(!dyad_df$edge_exists), "remain unconnected?\n")
```

### Adding Dyadic Covariates

What factors might predict tie formation in ECHO networks?

```{r dyadic-covariates}
# Enrich dyad data with attributes
dyad_df <- dyad_df %>%
  mutate(
    # Sender characteristics
    sender_type = nodes$node_type[match(sender, nodes$node_id)],
    sender_years = nodes$years_in_echo[match(sender, nodes$node_id)],
    sender_staff = nodes$staff_size[match(sender, nodes$node_id)],
    sender_participation = nodes$participation_rate[match(sender, nodes$node_id)],
    sender_state = nodes$state[match(sender, nodes$node_id)],
    
    # Receiver characteristics
    receiver_type = nodes$node_type[match(receiver, nodes$node_id)],
    receiver_years = nodes$years_in_echo[match(receiver, nodes$node_id)],
    receiver_staff = nodes$staff_size[match(receiver, nodes$node_id)],
    receiver_participation = nodes$participation_rate[match(receiver, nodes$node_id)],
    receiver_state = nodes$state[match(receiver, nodes$node_id)],
    
    # Dyadic characteristics (relationships between pairs)
    same_state = as.numeric(sender_state == receiver_state),
    same_type = as.numeric(sender_type == receiver_type),
    years_diff = abs(sender_years - receiver_years),
    staff_diff = abs(sender_staff - receiver_staff),
    
    # Transformations
    log_sender_staff = log(sender_staff + 1),
    log_receiver_staff = log(receiver_staff + 1)
  )

# Section 3: Advanced Network Models - The AMEN Framework

## Beyond Simple Formation Models

The logistic regression approach treats each dyad as independent, but in reality, network formation involves complex dependencies. The AMEN (Additive and Multiplicative Effects Network) model addresses these by explicitly modeling:

1.  **Sender heterogeneity**: Some actors are more active
2.  **Receiver heterogeneity**: Some actors are more popular
3.  **Dyadic correlation**: Reciprocity and transitivity
4.  **Latent homophily**: Unobserved similarities

```{r amen-framework}
cat("=== THE AMEN MODEL FRAMEWORK ===\n")
cat("=================================\n\n")

cat("CONCEPTUAL MODEL:\n")
cat("Y[i,j] = μ + β'X[i,j] + a[i] + b[j] + u[i]'v[j] + ε[i,j]\n\n")

# Dyadic covariates (same state)

diag(same_state_matrix) <- 0  # No self-loops

cat("• Network matrix:", dim(Y)[1], "x", dim(Y)[2], "\n")
cat("• Node covariates:", ncol(node_covariates), "variables\n")

# Note: Full AMEN implementation would use:

# Section 5: From Models to Action

## Translating Statistical Insights to Practice

Models are only valuable if they inform decisions. Let's extract actionable insights from our analyses:

```{r actionable-insights}
cat("=== ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS FROM MODELS ===\n")
cat("========================================\n\n")

# Finding 1: High-leverage intervention points
cat("FINDING 1: HIGH-LEVERAGE SITES\n")
cat("-------------------------------\n")

# Identify sites with high influence but low engagement
leverage_sites <- analysis_df %>%
  filter(type == "spoke") %>%
  mutate(
    influence = betweenness / max(betweenness),
    engagement = participation / 100,
    leverage = influence - engagement
  ) %>%
  arrange(desc(leverage)) %>%
  head(5)

cat("Sites with high network influence but low participation:\n")
leverage_sites %>%
  select(actor, betweenness, participation, leverage) %>%
  kable()

cat("\nRECOMMENDATION:\n")
cat("Target these sites for engagement interventions.\n")
cat("Small improvements here have network-wide effects.\n")
```

### Network Growth Strategies

```{r growth-strategies}

  group_by(relationship_type) %>%

    pct = n() / nrow(edges) * 100
  )

cat("Current network composition:\n")

# Based on formation model, identify missing connections
cat("\nGROWTH STRATEGY:\n")

# Calculate potential peer connections
