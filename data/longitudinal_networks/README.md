# Longitudinal ECHO Learning Network Dataset

## Dataset Overview
This synthetic dataset captures the growth and evolution of a Project ECHO telementoring network over 5 years (2019-2023), focusing on opioid use disorder (OUD) treatment in rural communities. It demonstrates typical ECHO network expansion patterns: starting with a small pilot, adding new spoke sites, incorporating subject matter experts, and developing peer learning connections as the network matures.

## Temporal Coverage
- **Time Period**: January 2019 - December 2023 (60 months)
- **Observation Points**: Quarterly snapshots (20 time periods)
- **Growth Pattern**: Organic expansion from 5 initial nodes to 42 nodes

## Network Evolution Summary
- **Q1 2019**: Launch with 1 hub + 4 pilot spokes
- **2019-2020**: Early growth, adding rural clinics
- **2021**: Expert integration and first peer connections
- **2022**: Rapid expansion with state funding
- **2023**: Network maturation with strong peer learning

## Key Temporal Patterns

### Growth Phases
1. **Pilot Phase (2019 Q1-Q3)**: Small, tight-knit group establishing protocols
2. **Early Expansion (2019 Q4-2020 Q4)**: Adding nearby clinics, building trust
3. **Expert Integration (2021 Q1-Q2)**: Bringing in specialists, diversifying content
4. **Rapid Growth (2021 Q3-2022 Q4)**: State funding enables broader recruitment
5. **Maturation (2023)**: Stable network with robust peer learning

### Evolution Indicators
- **Edge Persistence**: 78% of teaching edges last >8 quarters
- **Peer Learning Emergence**: First appears Q3 2020, accelerates after Q1 2021
- **Geographic Clustering**: Regional sub-networks emerge by 2022
- **Expertise Diversification**: Clinical-only â†’ multidisciplinary by 2021
